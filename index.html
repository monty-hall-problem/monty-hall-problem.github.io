    <p>
      In a game show, I present three doors: A, B, C. There is a new car behind one door and goats behind the others, but you don't know which door is the car.
      <br>
      You would definitely want to choose the car, right?
      <br>
      You pick a door, say A, and I will help you. I open another door, say C, and there is a goat behind it.
      <br>
      I give you the choice to choose either door A or door B.
      <br>
      Would you stay with your door A, or would you switch to door B?
